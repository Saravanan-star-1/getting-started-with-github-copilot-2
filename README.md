2. In the new tab, most of the fields will automatically fill in for you.

   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will use [Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.

3. Refresh your repository in about 10-20 seconds to see how to proceed as the README will get updated. The automation is already working to prepare the exercise.
