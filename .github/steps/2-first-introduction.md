## Step 2: First interaction with Copilot

There are many Copilot Features and interaction modes. In this step you will get to use some of them:

- **Code completions**: As you type, Copilot suggests code completions directly in your editor. Can generate entire functions based on comments or existing code context.
- **Copilot Chat**: A chat interface that lets you ask coding-related questions. You will see different modes in which you can use Copilot chat

> [!NOTE]
> You can see see all currently available GitHub Copilot features that are live or in preview in the documentation. See [GitHub Copilot Features](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/github-copilot-features)

**What is context?**: GitHub Copilot context refers to comments or existing code that Copilot uses to understand your intent and generate relevant code suggestions.

### :keyboard: Activity: Getting to know basic Copilot features :robot:

1. Open `src/app.py` file and let's start working on improving our High School API :robot:!.

   To start off - you will add additional validation to the `signup_for_activity` endpoint. Right now there is no logic to prevent users to sign to the same activity twice.

   Within the code of `signup_for_activity` endpoint, write a comment to provide Copilot context of what it is you are trying to do

   ```python
   # Validate student is not already signed
   ```

   Then press `Enter` to go to newline and Copilot will provide you with autocompletion suggestions!

   Press `Tab` to accept your first Copilot suggestion :tada: :robot:


   <details>
   <summary>Example suggestion</summary><br/>

   ```python
   @app.post("/activities/{activity_name}/signup")
   def signup_for_activity(activity_name: str, email: str):
      """Sign up a student for an activity"""
      # Validate activity exists
      if activity_name not in activities:
         raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Activity not found")

      # Validate student is not already signed
      if email in activities[activity_name]["participants"]:
         raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Student is already signed up")
      
      activity = activities[activity_name]

      # Add student
      activity["participants"].append(email)
      return {"message": f"Signed up {email} for {activity_name}"}
   ```
   </details>

   > **TIP**: If you would like to see other suggestions, instead of pressing `Tab`, hover over the suggestion and a small panel will show up. On it's right side click the three dots `...` and select `Open Completions Panel`


1. Open up Copilot Chat window and ask Copilot to help you create a completely new endpoint to the API

   ```txt
   Hey Copilot! Create a endpoint that will allow students to sign themselves out from an activity
   ```

   On the bottom part of Copilot Chat you can choose what AI Model Copilot should use. Different models can provide different results.

1. You can use Copilot Chat inline to stay in the flow. It's often used when you are dealing with problems or want to understand a specific part of the code.

   Hold down left button of your mouse and select this part of the file.

   ```python
   current_dir = Path(__file__).parent
   app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory=os.path.join(Path(__file__).parent,
          "static")), name="static")
   ```

   Then `Right click` =>`Copilot` => `Editor Inline Chat` and use the `/explain` function.

1. In the `Source Control` section on the left sidebar of VS Code.
   1. Click the `+` sign next to  `app.py` file to stage your changes.
   1. On the right side of the commit message window click :sparkles: to generate commit message with copilot
   1. Commit and sync your changes with the automatically generated message

1. Wait a moment for the bot to check your work. You will see a comment with progress info and the next lesson.

   <details>
   <summary>Having trouble? ðŸ¤·</summary><br/>

   If you don't get feedback, here are some things to check:

   - Make sure your pushed the `src/app.py` file changes to the branch `accelerate-with-copilot`.
