## Step 3: GitHub Copilot Edits

 [Copilot Edits](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-edits) works as an AI-powered code editing session to make changes across multiple files using natural language.

 Copilot Edits applies the edits directly in the editor, where you can review them in-place, with the full context of the surrounding code.

**Key features:**

- **Multi-file Editing**: Copilot Edits can make changes across multiple files in your workspace.
- **Iterative Workflow**: Designed for fast iteration, allowing you to review, accept, or discard AI-generated code.
- **In-place Edits**: Shows generated code directly in your editor, providing a code review-like flow.
- **Working Set**: Allows you to define which files the edits should be applied to.


**How it works:**

- **Set Context**: Define the working set by selecting files.
- **Provide Instructions**: Use natural language to tell Copilot what changes you need.
- **Review Changes**: See proposed changes in-place in your code
- **Accept or Discard**: Review each AI-generated edit and choose which changes to keep
- **Iterate**: Provide follow-up instructions and refine the changes as needed

1. Add the following files to the working set. Use the attach button in the bottom left corner of Copilot Edits view.
    - `src/static/app.js`
    - `src/static/index.html`
    - `src/static/styles.css`
1. Ask Copilot to add a new feature to the website.

    ```txt
    Hey Copilot. Edit the area where activities are listed on the website to show what participants are already signed for that activity.
    ```

    Copilot will generate inline edits for you. You can accept them or if this wasn't what you were hoping for, provide Copilot additional instructions.

    > **TIP:** On the bottom part of Copilot Edits you can choose what AI Model Copilot should use. Different models can provide different results.
